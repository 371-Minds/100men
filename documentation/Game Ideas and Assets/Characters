#### Dr. Aris Chen
Function: The Ghost in the Machine. Dr. Chen is the lead researcher and, likely, the architect of the simulation project that has gone so horribly wrong. She is not a character the player ever meets in person. Instead, she exists as the narrator of the apocalypse, her presence felt exclusively through corrupted audio logs, fragmented research notes, and glitched video diaries that the player discovers as lore fragments.

Personality & Arc: In the early logs, Aris is brilliant, confident, maybe a little arrogant. She speaks with the detached precision of a scientist who believes she has complete control over her experiment. As the game progresses and the player finds later logs, her voice changes. The professional facade cracks, revealing awe, then confusion, then terror. She goes from documenting a subject to witnessing something that defies her understanding of physics and biology. Her final logs would be frantic, filled with whispers about "shifting realities," "the same entity, but different," and the horrifying realization that she didn't create a simulation—she opened a window.

In-Game Presence: Her voice, distorted by cheap mics and data corruption, will be the player's primary guide through the mystery. A low-poly, glitched-out render of her face might appear on a broken monitor, her ID badge (CHEN, A. - Xeno-Behavioral Dynamics) the only clear thing on screen. She is the human element that grounds the cosmic horror of it all.

#### Singleton Asset Designation: K-PRIME
Classification: The Anomaly. "K-PRIME" is the internal designation for the first Singleton asset the player encounters—the Gorilla. It is not simply an animal. It is a physical impossibility, a creature of immense size and strength whose presence seems to warp the environment around it. Its intelligence is the most terrifying thing about it.

Physical & Behavioral Profile: Visually, it's a hulking, low-poly nightmare. Think less photorealistic gorilla, more a crude, powerful silhouette that moves with unnatural speed and purpose. Its eyes might glow with a faint, intelligent light in the darkness. Its behavior is not that of a rampaging beast, but a seasoned predator and tactician. It uses the environment for ambushes, seems to anticipate flanking maneuvers, and displays a level of problem-solving that suggests it understands it's being hunted and is actively turning the tables. Its rage isn't mindless; it's focused, cold, and unsettlingly personal.

Narrative Purpose: K-PRIME is the central question of the game. It is the living embodiment of the "Primal vs. Protocol" conflict. It is proof that Dr. Chen's experiment has connected to something ancient and terrifying. Each time the player faces it, they aren't just fighting a boss; they are confronting a piece of the larger, unknowable puzzle. The mystery isn't "can we kill it," but "what is it?"
