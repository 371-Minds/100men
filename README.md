# Singleton Fury

**A universe of asymmetric conflict, where the fate of the many rests on the identity of the One.**

## Game Concept

This game offers two distinct gameplay experiences:

### As the Gorilla
- Play as a powerful gorilla with immense strength and durability
- Action-based combat with special abilities and power-ups
- Survive against waves of men using the environment to your advantage
- Progression system to unlock new abilities and increase your power

### As the 100 Men
- Command a tactical squad of 100 men with different abilities and equipment
- Strategic deployment and resource management
- Research and develop new technologies and weapons
- Use teamwork and tactics to overcome the gorilla's raw power

## The Singleton Fury Vision

- **A Franchise of Asymmetric Conflict:** Singleton Fury is more than just the "Gorilla vs 100 Men" scenario (now known as "Singleton Fury: Primal"). It's a brand for a series of games exploring various asymmetric conflicts across different timelines and settings (e.g., Singleton Fury: Uprising, Singleton Fury: Anomaly).
- **The Mystery of the Singleton:** A core narrative hook across all titles is the ambiguous identity of the "Singleton" - the one force or individual facing the many. This mystery is explored through shifting timelines and provides deep lore for the community.
- **Community-Driven Universe:** We are building a platform that empowers players and creators. Expect strong community features and the ability for players to contribute to the Singleton Fury universe through user-generated content.
